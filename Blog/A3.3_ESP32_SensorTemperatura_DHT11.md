2. Based on the images shown in **Figure 1**, assemble the circuit into a single electronic circuit, in such a way that a system capable of complying with the instructions previously requested for this activity can be obtained.

</p>

3. Once the above circuit is assembled, add an RGB LED and create the program that allows the RGB LED to function as an indicator for the following conditions:
    - The temperature sensor will be sensing at all times, sending the value registered by the serial terminal, for example "Ambient temperature: 25 degrees" and the **RGB LED** will be lit green.
    - When the temperature sensor registers a value of ~ 20% above the ambient temperature, it should display the message "High temperature:? Degrees" and the **RGB LED** will turn red.
    - When the temperature sensor registers a value of ~ 20% below the ambient temperature, it should display the message "Low temperature:? Degrees" and the **RGB LED** will turn blue.

4. Place here evidence that you consider important during the development of the activity.

<p>DHT11 sensor is a digital sensor we can measure the humidity and temperature. In our case for this practice only used it for measuring the temperature also we used a RGB LED for showing three condictions  when we have a low temperature the led will on in color blue, en the second case when it´s ambient temperature the led will on color green y the last case when it´s high temperature the led will on color red. In this practice we had  problems when tried to upload the code but fortunately we could solvede it.</p>

<p>By doing this practice, I was able to know in detail the operation of the DHT22 sensor, and some curiosities of the ESP32 (specifically the D2 pin). We were able to measure the temperature and we made the LED change color by means of conditions that we adjusted depending on the ambient temperature registered by the sensor.</p>

<p>
During the practice with the DHT22 we had experience so detecting and measuring temperature was not a problem, but using the RGB LEDs we had no experience and less with the ESP32 with which we were having an error with which the program did not load, but my partner found that the origin was pin 2 we were using. Other than that, it was relatively easy to do the practice.</p>

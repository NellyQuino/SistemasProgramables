## :pencil2: Development

1. Use the following list of materials to prepare the activity

| Quantity | Description|
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Sensor [Ultrasonico HC-SR04](https://www.amazon.com.mx/SainSmart-HC-SR04-Ranging-Detector-Distance/dp/B004U8TOE6/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=hc-sr04&qid=1599005012&sr=8-5)            |
| 1         | Display LCD de 16x2
| 1        | 5V voltage source  |
| 1        | [1 10k potentiometer ](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Uxcell-a15011600ux0235-Linear-Rotary-Potentiometer/dp/B01DKCUVMQ/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=potenciometro+10k&qid=1599005041&sr=8-1) |
| 1        | [Arduino UNO](https://www.amazon.com.mx/Progressive-Automations-LC-066-Arduino-Rev3/dp/B00WH5XOJK/ref=sr_1_7?__mk_es_MX=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=arduino+uno&qid=1599005073&sr=8-7)


2. Based on the image shown, assemble inside the simulator to be used, the electronic circuit indicated in **Figure 1**

</p>


3. Carry out the program that allows, through one of the Arduino's inputs, to receive the value registered by the **Ultrasonic Sensor** when approaching an object at different distances.

</p>

4. Considering that the ultrasonic sensor has a minimum and maximum detection range based on the return time of the sonic signal, which values ​​are obtained in the simulation under the **following conditions:**


| Number | Condition 1 | Condition2 | The object is detected? |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| 1 | 5 cm distance to the sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor |Yes
| 2 | 50 cm distance to the sensor | 35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor |Yes
| 3 | 100 cm distance to the sensor | -35 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor |Yes
| 4 | 5 cm distance to the sensor | 90 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor |No
| 5 | 50 cm distance to the sensor | -60 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor |Yes
| 6 | 350 cm distance to the sensor | 0 degrees to the perpendicular axis of the sensor|No

5. Once the previous points have been completed, add to Figure 1, **an I2C 16x2 LCD Display**, and place the image of the completed circuit up to this section.

</p>

6. When you have completed the integration of the I2C Display, set the program that allows you through the display to show the following message, **"Target detected at? Cm**, and if detection is not achieved, indicate the message **"Target out of range"**

<p>We used the hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor to measure objects detection thanks to it's have one transmitting side that sends the ultrasonic  wave that collides with the object for then return it to receiver  side and we used pulseIn for know which´s is the duration  and then to  know which's distance the object.</p>

## :camera: Michelle Gasca
<p>The ultrasonic sensor is useful in various projects where distance measurement is involved. In practice we check the different ranges where the sensor can detect objects, and to tell the truth, it does not have a wide range, so it is very limited to simple projects. Although, if used well, it could be exploited even more.</p>

## :coffee: Francisco Villarreal 
<p>The hc-sr04 ultrasonic sensor measures the distance using 2 sensors, one which sends a sound and the other which receives the sound and depending on the formula we use, we can measure the distance it traveled and make an estimate of where the object is placed.</p>

2. Based on the images shown in **Figure 1**, make a system capable of meeting the following conditions

 The first phase of the activity will consist of, when placing an object in front of the RGB sensor, it should identify what color it has (it is advisable to use Red, Green, and Blue objects for greater precision), which should be displayed on an interface visual what color was detected.

   - The second phase will consist of adding an actuator and a color identifier supported by a color band as shown in image 1; When knowing the color of the object, the actuator should point to the color that is being detected.

<p>In the first part for this activity we used the ESP32 with the  RGB TCS34725 sensor for detecting what color the object is so we needed to detect a object in three situations when was red, blue or green and then showed the colors changes  in a interface in our case Blynk we used Wi-Fi to conect us with it  how the last activity, In  the second part we had to add a Servomotor SG90 which moved on a band of colors (green,red or blue) according what color the object is detected  by the sensor for it we had to implemented some librarys like Servo_ESP32.h  and  Adafruit_TCS34725.h in the code so we could create objects with which we could work with the components and  manipulating it until reading and received data.
During the development of the activity we looked infomation that helped us to development this activity how was requirement. We had some problems but we solve it changed values until it will even work. Try and failure.</p>

## :camera: Michelle Gasca
<p>Making the connection of the RGB sensor was a bit simple, but when it came to programming the functions it would have, it was where it got complicated. We wanted to assign 4 positions where 1 of them would show the value "not detected", so we were investigating and writing different ways to detect this state. In addition, we were complicated by the fact that we could not solder the sensor, and it constantly had false contacts that prevented the reading of data. The lighting of the room where the practice was carried out also influenced in a certain way, because the light threw different values ​​and made it even more difficult for us to do it.
Thinking about the operation of the sensor, I got the idea that a function could be made that traverses the value of the photodiodes, to later be interpreted by some external tool, and that represents the frequency obtained in the form of a pixel of the same color, and Of course, using some optics that converges the image exactly on the sensor, with which we would obtain a camera with a very low resolution, at a perhaps slow frequency, but in the end it would be that; a camera.</p>

During the development of the practice, getting the sensor and servomotor to work was relatively simple, since there were several tutorials that we could rely on and luckily we found libraries that gave us direct control of the servomotor and the LDR to read the colors with the sensor relatively straightforward. We could not make it stand by while there was no color, so we investigated and found a way to make a more raw reading of the colors giving us the option of clear in case no color was detected with that we managed to make the stand by work. In the case of the LDR, there are still options that we could observe to make different readings of the colors and also for what we were able to observe this the option of creating our own library depending on the colors that we have and knowing the values ​​of those colors that the LDR throws on ESP32.</p>

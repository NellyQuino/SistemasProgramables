2. Based on the image shown in **Figure 1**, assemble an electronic circuit and add a Led and a relay to one of the device's terminals, in such a way that a system capable of complying with the following instructions:
    - The NodeMCU should be used as a **standalone Web server**, which should provide a visual interface, which will show an image representing an "ON and OFF" behavior depending on the ambient lighting condition.
    - The lighting sensor must be measuring the amount of light that exists in the environment.
    - When detecting the LDR sensor, the absence of light should show an "ON" status on the Web interface, and otherwise the "OFF" status should be represented.
    - A relay in series with a light bulb must be added to the circuit in figure 1, which will be activated in the opposite condition to the "ON" and "OFF" state, that is, once the sensor detects little or no lighting, it will activate the relay. and consequently it will turn on the bulb, and otherwise it will turn it off.

<p>In this practice we used the ESP32 with the Wi-Fi communication protocol, a LDR sensor and a LED. We assembled the circuit based on the image provided to us, in the moment when we assambled the circuit we had a problem when try to used the GND because the cuircuit didn´t detect it so we conected it direcly in the ESP32 we know that's not recommended but in this case we had no other. Once already armed the circuit we needed to do was show a on messege when the LDR sensor wasn't detect the lights and show the off message when it detect the lights after then we integrated a LED and a reley to saw the changes better and finally in the code use a virtual varible to comunicate with the Wi-Fi app.</p>

## :camera: Michelle Gasca
<p>When doing this practice, we configure the ESP32 module for the first time to access a WiFi network, and thus use an application from a cell phone. Regarding the part of the remote interface programming, it was a bit confusing at first, but when we practiced, we knew how to make the necessary adjustments to be able to receive the data from the led when it was turned off or on. Also, the use of the relay was somewhat unknown at first, but as the practice and development of the same code, we understood that it was a type of logic gate, and it worked as a condition in our circuit. The photoresistance acted as the condition to turn on the led, because when it stopped detecting light, it turned it on and vice versa.</p>

## :coffee: Francisco Villarreal 
<p>During the practice that we used the relay, ESP32 and the LDR it was relatively easy to make the LED turn on with the LDR and with the relay we were concerned about the voltage, since many videos and pages warned us to be careful and we did not want to burn anything or hurt ourselves , but since we did the practice with LEDs instead of a light bulb it was simple, at first we had a problem with what the earth was, since for some reason it did not detect it, but we put it next to the ESP32 and it managed to work. Finally, the interface that we can see through wifi, we opted to use blynk, since it did not saturate the code interface and it was easier to use, since with the virtual pins we could see that the led turns on and off.</p>
